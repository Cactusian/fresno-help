## 1. Call Received

When you receive a mod call, please only respond if you are on-shift.

<Note>
  Once teleported, if you notice that a different staff member has already teleported first and they don't need additional assistance, you may teleport back to your previous location.
</Note>

Introduce yourself with a welcome message like the one provided below:

_Hello! I am Raf with Fresno Roleplay, how can I assist you today?_

As an on-shift staff in-game, you must always used SPaG (spelling, punctuation, and grammar). Do not use low-effort lazy messages that make you seem unprofessional or don't provide clear information.

## 2. Discord Check

If the situation is not an emergency (e.g., mass RDM occurring at the scene), please ensure that all the players present are in the Discord server before offering assistance. If they are not in the server, politely ask them to join and give them a reasonable amount of time to do so. If they refuse or take an unnecessarily long time, you may proceed to kick them.

## 3. Providing Assistance

Assist the player who requested help with their inquiry to the best of your ability. If you're unsure how to handle the situation or need additional support, don't hesitate to ask another staff member or an HR to step in.

<Warning>
  If a player requests an HR without first explaining the issue or providing a reasonable justification, politely deny their request and invite them to create a support ticket in the Discord server instead.
</Warning>

## 4. Giving out Punishments

If you need to issue any punishments, always do so professionally. Before warning, kicking, or banning a player, clearly explain the reason to them to ensure transparency. Let them know your decision can be appealed in the Discord Server and if they are getting kicked make sure to inform them of the 30 minute (or more if you decide) kick wait.

## 5. Ending the Mod Call

Once all the steps above have been completed, ask the player if they need any further assistance. If they do, continue helping them as outlined in Step 3. If not, you may return to your previous location.
