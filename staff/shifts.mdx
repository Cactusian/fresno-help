## 1. What is a Shift

A shift represents your in-game activity as a staff member during a server session.

## 2. Weekly Quota

Currently, there is a weekly quota of 4 hours. As a staff member, you are expected to dedicate a minimum of 4 hours each week actively moderating and supporting the server in-game.

The quota resets every Monday. For your first week after being hired, any shortfall in meeting the quota will not be considered an offense. However, if you fail to meet the weekly quota while not on any active LOAs in the other weeks, appropriate punishment will be given.

<Warning>
  The weekly quota is subject to change at any time and without prior notice, depending on the current needs of the server. Changes will be minor, with the required hours increasing or decreasing slightly as necessary. If the quota changes and you find yourself unable to meet the new requirements, please reach out to your director as soon as possible.
</Warning>

## 3. Going On-Shift

When starting your shift, please ensure you are fully prepared. Join the sheriff team in-game, equip your staff uniform, spawn your staff vehicle, and then begin your shift on Melonly.

Please do not start your shift if you plan on going AFK, as this is considered shift grinding and is strictly prohibited. If you need to step away for more than 10 minutes, you must end your shift. However, if your break will be under 10 minutes, you may use the break feature instead.

## 4. Going Off-Shift

When you decide to end your shift, please make sure to stop it on Melonly, unequip your staff uniform, and change your staff vehicle.

Failure to properly end your shift on Melonly will result in punishment. Additionally, **shift grinding is strictly prohibited** and considered a serious offense.
