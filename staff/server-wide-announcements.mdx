Announcements must always use SPaG (spelling, punctuation, and grammar) and be as professional and clearly written as possible. There's two types of server-wide announcements:

## 1. Messages (:m)

The message command `:m` is only used for very important and crticial announcements related to current events in the server. You may NOT use :m to announce: department briefings, reminders to use voice channels, etc.

## 2. Hints (:h)

The hint command `:h` is used to announce less-critical announcements that do not require immediate attention. This includes things like department briefings, small or informal events, minor updates, reminders, and general notices.
