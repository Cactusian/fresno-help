Leading a department at Fresno Roleplay comes with significant responsibilities, commitments, and conditions. To earn and maintain your position, you must fully understand and commit to the guidelines outlined below. All department leaders are required to read, agree to, and adhere to the following information.

## 1. Professionalism

As a department leader at Fresno Roleplay, you are expected to maintain a professional attitude and approach your responsibilities with seriousness and integrity. You must lead with fairness, uphold high standards, and ensure that both your department and the server reflect positively on the community as a whole.

## 2. Fairness

You are expected to manage your department with fairness, impartiality, and integrity at all times. Favoritism, free-ranking, discrimination, or any form of bias is strictly prohibited. Engaging in such behavior may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal from your position.

## 3. Respecting Decisions

If you are given an order by a department overseer or a member of the foundership team, you are expected to comply without refusal or unnecessary delay. While you are encouraged to voice your concerns respectfully and provide feedback if you believe something is unfair, the final decision ultimately rests with leadership, not you.

## 4. Misuse of Power

Abuse of power in any form, whether towards members, your department, or the server, is strictly prohibited. Misconduct may lead to serious consequences, including removal from your position, a permanent ban, and blacklisting from Fresno Roleplay, depending on the severity of the situation.

## 5. Your Work

All work you create or contribute as part of your role within the department instantly becomes the property of Fresno Roleplay. By submitting your work, you grant Fresno Roleplay the full rights to use, modify, and distribute it as needed, even in the event of your departure or removal from the team.

This includes, but is not limited to: any Discord servers you set up for the department, custom Discord embeds or bots created for departmental use, as well as documents, handbooks, media, and other related materials.
