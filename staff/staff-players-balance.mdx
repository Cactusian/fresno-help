title: "Staff / Players Balance"
---

During sessions, the number of on-shift staff in-game **should not exceed 1/4 of the player count**.\
_(As an example, if there's 10 players in-game, there shouldn't be more than 2-3 staff on-shift.)_

This is done to ensure that the server is active and that roleplays are still happening regardless of the player count.

If you are instructed by HR to go off-shift, please comply with their request. In such cases, you are permitted to keep your shift on while roleplaying to meet your quota (only if you haven't already).
