## 1. Justice

The Fresno Police department upholds justice by enforcing laws fairly and without bias, ensuring every individual is treated with dignity under the California state law. Our duty is to protect the rights of all citizens while holding the unlawful accountable through professional, lawful actions.

## 2. Integrity

Integrity means that every member of the Police Department acts with honesty, accountability and transparency, both on and off duty. We follow policy, report misconduct and make decisions based on truth, not personal gain or favoritism.

## 3. Freedom

The Police Department protects the freedoms guaranteed by the State of California law, including freedom of speech, due process and lawful self-defense. Our mission is to safeguard these liberties by maintaining order without infringing on the rights of the public.
