## 2. Driving

Remain at a safe distance: Remaining at a 4-6 seconds follow distance between your vehicle and the evading vehicle.

- **Overtaking:** You may only overtake another LEO vehicle if the vehicle is failing to meet the speeds required or is causing endangerment due to their driving. This must be called out.
- **Right of Way:** When attaching to a pursuit you must allow the pursuit to pass and then you can attach.
- **Opposite Lanes of Traffic:** Officers may only drive on the correct side of the road at all times during a pursuit is possible, if not use the emergency lane

## 3. Interventions

PIT maneuvers may not be executed until the P.i.T. timer has expired. This timer is set by a dispatcher, supervisor or the unit who initiated the pursuit. This timer may be overruled by a supervisor if the suspect is reckless within city limits.\
\
Spike strips may only be deployed after the PIT timer has expired. They are to be issued if the suspect’s behavior is consistent and on consistently leading roads.\
\
The following roads are considered Spike Roads, these are the only places where spike strips may be allowed:

- Highway 55
- Riverside Drive
- Freedom Avenue
- Colonial Drive

When deploying or using spike strips, you must call it out via the LEO RTO.
